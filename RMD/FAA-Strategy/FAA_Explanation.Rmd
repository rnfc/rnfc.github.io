# Strategy Explanation

This strategy extends the timeseries momentum (or trendfollowing) model towards a generalized momentum model, called Flexible Asset Allocation (FAA). This is done by adding new momentum factors to the traditional momentum factor (R) based on the relative returns among assets. These new factors are called Absolute momentum (A), Volatility momentum (V) and Correlation momentum (C).

Each asset is ranked on each of the four factors R, A, V and C. By using a linearised representation of a loss function representing risk/return, we are able to arrive at simple closed form solutions for our flexible asset allocation strategy based on these four factors. 

The strategy is based on monthly re-balancing, signal is generated one day before the month end, and execution is done at the market close on the month end.

# ETFs Used in the Strategy

To backtest this strategy, we used the following asset classes represented by the following ETFs:

* US STOCKS = VTI + VTSMX
    * US Stocks are represented by VTI (Vanguard Total Stock Market ETF) with its price history being extended by                  VTSMX (Vanguard Total Stock Market Index Fund Investor Shares)
        * VTI - Seeks to track the performance of the CRSP US Total Market Index
        * VTSMX -  Designed to provide investors with exposure to the entire U.S. equity market, including small-, mid-, and                       large-cap growth and value stocks
* FOREIGN STOCKS = VEU + FDIVX
    * Foreign Stocks are represented by VEU (Vanguard FTSE All-World ex-US ETF) with its price history being extended by           FDIVX (Fidelity Diversified International Fund)
        * VEU - Seeks to track the performance of the FTSE All-World ex US Index

* US 10YR GOV BOND = IEF + VFITX
    * US 10 Year Government Bonds are represented by IEF (iShares 7-10 Year Treasury Bond ETF) with its price history being         extended by VFITX (Vanguard Intermediate-Term Treasury Fund Investor Shares)
        * IEF - Seeks to track the performance of the Barclays U.S. 7-10 Year Treasury Bond Index
        * VFITX - This fund invests in debt issued directly by the government in the form of intermediate-term treasuries
        
\pagebreak

* REAL ESTATE = VNQ + VGSIX
    * Real Estate is represented by VNQ (iShares 7-10 Year Treasury Bond ETF) with its price history being extended by VGSIX       (Vanguard Intermediate-Term Treasury Fund Investor Shares)
